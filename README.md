# PhoneBook
The PhoneBook application is an address book type program that lets you add contacts, search through your contacts, and also remove contacts.
This was the first project we worked on in Java bootcamp
First commit was my initial solution based on what I knew in the beginning
ContactsMethods contains updated add, search, and remove methods, using ArrayList instead of Array.
